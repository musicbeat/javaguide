# [javaguide](https://github.com/musicbeat/javaguide)

The [javaguide](https://github.com/musicbeat/javaguide) is a Java code and style guide adapted from [Google's Java Style Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html). Google was kind enough to make this and other language guides available under the [Creative Commons (CC BY 3.0) License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which allows unlimited modification and reuse, requiring only attribution.

So far, all that has been changed is to use "Blackhawk" instead of "Google", and "com.bhn" instead of "com.google".
